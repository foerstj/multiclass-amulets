# multiclass-amulets
Amulets to fill the str/dex/int gap when multiclassing.

These amulets fill up the missing strength, dexterity, and intelligence for multiclass characters.\
They are designed to fit characters that multiclass two different skills (e.g. melee and nature magic) evenly.\
The amulets require both the skill levels and the str/dex/int that an evenly-leveled multiclass character has.

Example with melee and nature magic:\
When you multiclass evenly, at a point where a singleclass character would reach level 50, you reach level 45 in both skills. (Your character has uber level 50.)\
But your strength is 10 points lower than what a singleclass melee character would have at level 45, and your intelligence is 12 points lower than what a singleclass nature magic character would have.\
Therefore, the "Melee + Nature Magic, Uber Level 50" amulet gives you additional 10 strength and 12 intelligence.

The amulets are available for all combinations of two skills except nature magic + combat magic, because there both skills mainly increase intelligence so they go together just fine. They are provided in steps of 10 uber levels.

- For playing with the mod, you only need Multiclass Amulets.dsres
- For buying amulets with a multiplayer character, use Multiclass Amulets Shop.dsmap and Multiclass Amulets Shop.dsres
- For buying amulets in a singleplayer campaign, use Multiclass Amulets in Original Shops.dsres - this will conflict with other mods that also modify original shop NPCs.
